# üîÑ S.W.A.P. (Shift-Workers Arrangement Platform): Conquer Your Calendar Chaos!

**(Unofficial Name: Shift Happens - We had to go with the more professional acronym, but let's be real, shifts *do* happen, and we're here to help you manage them!)**

## The Problem: Your Calendar is a Hot Mess, and Your Team is Not Happy About It. üò´

Let's face it, managing work schedules can feel like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded while riding a unicycle. You've got shifts flying around like confetti, people swapping days like they're trading baseball cards, and your Google Calendar? It looks like a Jackson Pollock painting after a particularly messy food fight. You're drowning in a sea of manual scheduling, shift-swapping shenanigans, and communication breakdowns. It should be a system, a platform, a way to arrange that, a *S.W.A.P.*!

- **Manual calendar wrangling** is a time-sucking vortex that leads to errors and frustration.
- **Shift-swapping** is a chaotic dance of favors, guilt trips, and awkward conversations. The complexity of the shift-swapping should be handled by a system, automatically.
- **Communication breakdowns** lead to missed shifts, scheduling conflicts, and a whole lot of unnecessary stress. And anxiety on checking all the time if nothing had changed.
- **Lack of visibility** makes it hard to see everyone's availability at a glance, leading to scheduling nightmares.
- **Alerts and notifications about schedule changes are unreliable & inconsistent**
- Multiple departments with its own calendar, multiplying the complexity.

You need a solution that's automated, transparent, and easy to use. You need... **S.W.A.P.!**

## The Solution: S.W.A.P. - Your All-In-One Shift Scheduling Savior! ü¶∏

S.W.A.P. (Shift-Workers Arrangement Platform) is a powerful, flexible, and dare we say, *fun* web application built to bring order to the chaos of shift management. Think of it as your personal scheduling superhero, but without the cape and the need to fight crime in tights (unless you're into that, no judgment here).

**Here's how S.W.A.P. will revolutionize your scheduling world:**

- **Automation for the win**: Streamline scheduling, reduce errors, and free up your time for more important things (like finally beating that level in Candy Crush).
- **Empowered employees, happy team**: Give your team self-service shift management tools, making everyone's lives easier and boosting morale.
- **Crystal-clear communication**: Keep everyone in the loop with automated alerts and a transparent system that eliminates confusion.
- **Bird's-eye view of your team**: Get a clear overview of your entire team's schedule, so you can plan like a pro and avoid scheduling conflicts.
- **Data-driven insights**: Track key metrics and make informed decisions about staffing, resource allocation, and scheduling optimization.

## Project Phases: Your Roadmap to Scheduling Nirvana (with Technical Details!) ‚ú®

We're building this scheduling utopia one step at a time. Here's a more in-depth look at our journey, with some technical tidbits sprinkled in:

### Phase 1: Google Calendar Sync - Taming the Calendar Beast with APIs! üóìÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏èü§ñ (Completed)

-   **The Solution**:
    -   Utilize the **Google Calendar API** to fetch events from user-selected calendars.
    -   Implement robust error handling and data validation to ensure data integrity.
    -   Develop a **Python-based synchronization service** that runs periodically to keep S.W.A.P. up-to-date with Google Calendar.
    -   Use **OAuth 2.0** for secure user authentication and authorization.
-   **Technical Details**:
    -   **Libraries**: `google-api-python-client`, `google-auth-oauthlib`
    -   **Data Transformation**: Convert Google Calendar event data into S.W.A.P.'s internal data models.
    -   **Synchronization Logic**: Implement efficient algorithms to detect and handle event changes, additions, and deletions.
    -   **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle API rate limits, network issues, and data inconsistencies.
-   **The Outcome**: A solid foundation for our scheduling empire. No more manual entry! Shifts magically appear in S.W.A.P., ready to be managed.

### Phase 2: Database Integration - The PostgreSQL-Powered Brains of the Operation üß† (Completed)

-   **The Challenge**: Create a robust and scalable database to store all of S.W.A.P.'s data, including users, organizations, departments, shifts, notifications, and more.
-   **The Solution**:
    -   Design a relational database schema using **PostgreSQL** for its reliability, performance, and advanced features (like JSONB support for flexible data).
    -   Utilize **SQLModel** (which combines SQLAlchemy and Pydantic) for defining database models, relationships, and performing database operations.
    -   Implement data validation and integrity constraints at the database level.
-   **Technical Details**:
    -   **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+
    -   **ORM**: SQLModel/SQLAlchemy
    -   **Data Models**: Defined using Python classes with type hints, ensuring data consistency.
    -   **Relationships**: Implemented using foreign keys and relationship attributes in SQLModel.
    -   **Migrations**: Database migrations will be managed with **Alembic**.
-   **The Outcome**: A reliable, efficient, and scalable database that can handle the complexities of a dynamic scheduling system.

### Phase 3: Telegram Alerts - Instant Notifications via Chatbots! üîî

-   **The Challenge**: Implement a real-time notification system to keep users informed about schedule changes, swap requests, and other important updates.
-   **The Solution**:
    -   Integrate with the **Telegram API** to send notifications via a custom Telegram bot.
    -   Develop a notification service that can handle different notification types and user preferences.

    -   Allow users to customize their notification settings (e.g., choose which types of notifications they want to receive).
-   **Technical Details**:
    -   **Library**: `python-telegram-bot`
    -   **Bot Creation**: Create and configure a Telegram bot using BotFather.
    -   **Notification Service**: Build a Python service that formats and sends notifications via the Telegram API.
    -   **User Preferences**: Store user notification preferences in the database.
-   **The Outcome**: No more missed shifts due to unchecked emails! Everyone gets timely updates directly to their phones via Telegram.

### Phase 4: Basic Frontend -  React-Powered User Interface üíÖ

-   **The Challenge**: Build a user-friendly and intuitive frontend for interacting with S.W.A.P.
-   **The Solution**:
