# 🗓️ **S.W.A.P. — Shift-Workers Arrangement Platform**

> "_There is no spoon._" – The Matrix  
_(Schedules shouldn't bend you—bend them to your will!)_

S.W.A.P. simplifies life for shift workers by seamlessly syncing work rotas from Google Sheets directly into Google Calendar. Born out of love—to help Rachel manage her scheduling chaos effortlessly—it’s adaptable for anyone stuck dealing with messy, manual schedules.

## 🚧 **The Problem**

Shift schedules can quickly turn into chaos:

- 📉 Frustrating manual copying and updating.
- ⏱️ Missed appointments due to scheduling mistakes.
- 🌪️ Endless confusion about complex rotas and changes.

## 🦸‍♂️ **S.W.A.P. to the Rescue**

The Shift-Workers Arrangement Platform (S.W.A.P.) automates everything:

- 🌟 Parses shift data directly from Google Sheets.
- 🔄 Automatically syncs events with Google Calendar.
- 📆 Seamlessly maintains and updates your scheduling—_effortlessly_.

What started as a personal tool for Rachel has become an intuitive platform to help shift-workers everywhere gain back control.

## 🐳 **Docker Lovers, We've Got You Covered**

Want containerized & hassle-free deploys?

**Build and run:**
```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t swap-rota-sync .

# Run the container with your service account
docker run \
  -v /path/to/your/service-account.json:/app/service-account.json \
  swap-rota-sync
```

Let Docker manage your deployments while you relax (or perhaps watch some One Piece 🍿🏴‍☠️).

## 🛠️ **Customize It, Make it Yours**

S.W.A.P. was built to scale. Tweak this simple config for any worker in the script:

```python
USERS = [
    {
        "CALENDAR_NAME": "Rachel's Rota",
        "USER_NAME": "Rachel",
        "EMAILS_TO_SHARE": [
            "your.email@example.com"
        ],
    },
]
```

_Set your username, calendar names, and sharing emails to suite your workflow._
